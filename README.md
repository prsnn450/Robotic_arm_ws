# Robotic_arm_ws
## Overview
This repository contains the source code and configuration files for the KUKA robotic arm controlled using ROS2 and MoveIt. The project simulates the robotic arm's movements using Gazebo and visualizes them using Rviz.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-gazebo-ros
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-control*
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-gazebo-plugins
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-moveit-visual-tools
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-graph-msgs

Clone the Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:

sh

git clone https://github.com/prsnn450/Robotic_arm_ws.git

Replace prsnn450 with your GitHub username if you are trying to clone your own repository.
Next Steps

After cloning the repository, follow these steps:

    Navigate to the Workspace:

    sh

cd Robotic_arm_ws

Build the Workspace:

sh

    colcon build

    This command will compile the project and generate the necessary build, install, and log directories.

Running the Project

Once the workspace is built, you can run the project. Detailed instructions for running simulations, controlling the robotic arm, and visualizing its movements in Gazebo and RViz should follow in your README.

### Explanation

- **Markdown Structure**: Markdown uses `#` for headings and triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code blocks. It's crucial to maintain proper indentation and syntax to ensure that the Markdown renders correctly.
- **Cloning the Repository**: Ensure the correct URL format (`git clone <repository-url>`) is used within the Markdown code block.

Make sure you save this content into your README.md file in your repository. Adjust the GitHub repository URL (`https://github.com/prsnn450/Robotic_arm_ws.git`) to match your actual repository URL. This structure will help users understand how to set up and run your project effectively.

can you give it as a single file in a single box dont seperate it so that I can directly copy and paste it
